# Cypress
In this repository, you will find my Cypress projects and tests

Main things about Cypress:
1. Cypress can test anything that runs on a web browser
2. Cypress doesn't use Selenium at the backend
3. Automatic Waiting automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on
4. Cross-browser testing locally or remotely (CI/CD)

Cypress important commands:
1. <strong>npm init -y</strong> create a file called package.json in a project. This is dependency management file.

2. npm install cypress install the latest Cypress version.
   
3. npm install cypress@12.0 install a particular Cypress version.
